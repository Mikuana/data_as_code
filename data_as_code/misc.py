    Prepare step ingredient

    Use the metadata from a previously executed step as an ingredient for
    another step. This function is a wrapper to allowing passing the results of
    a previous step directly to the next, while still allowing context hints to
    function appropriately.

    The typehint says that the return is a :class:`pathlib.Path` object, but
    that is a lie; the return is actually a semi-private Ingredient class. This
    mismatch is done intentionally to allow all ingredients in a step to be
    identified without first knowing the names of the attributes that they will
    be assigned to. Once the ingredients are captured, the attribute is
    reassigned to the path attribute for the ingredient, allowing the path to
    be called directly from inside the :class:`Step.instructions`
