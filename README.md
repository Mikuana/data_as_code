# Data as Code

This package provides tools which can be used to strictly define, version control,
and document data. To sum it up, this package treats Data as Code (DaC) in the
instances where that is possible.

This framework is designed for tabular, file-based data sets, and works best with
fixed, unchanging files (although it can also be used for changing data, but some
of the tools in this framework are rendered moot by these changes).

The product generated by this framework is a tabular data set which includes
complete documentation of the original source, intermediate steps of transformation,
and hash sums to guarantee that the data match the associated code.


Stages:
 - Get
 - (Optional) unpack/inflate
 - Parse
 - Transform
 - Package
 - Distribute


# Concepts

 - **Artifact**: an objects which represents data, and provide a direct means of
    obtaining it, typically via file path

     - **MockSource**: a lineage *artifact* which precedes the *source*, but
        which is not actually available for use by the recipe. Allows for a more
        complete lineage to be declared when appropriate

     - **Source**: primary data *artifact*; the "original" that is used by a
        *recipe*, before it has been changed in any way
     
     - **Intermediary**: an intermediate data *artifact* that is the result of
        applying incremental changes to a *source*, but not yet the final data
        product produced by the *recipe*. Not meant to be used outside of the
        recipe, and treated as disposable
     
     - **Product**: the ultimate data *artifact* produced by a *recipe*, which is
        intended for use outside the *recipe*. Includes the complete *lineage*
        as a component of the packaged product, and optionally includes the
        *recipe* that was used to create it 

 - **Processor**: a step where data artifacts are changed in any way
 
    - **Bypass**: a *processor* that does not actually do the work, but instead
        represents work that occurs outside of the *recipe*. Useful if data are
        treated by a third-party, or by other software that cannot be
        represented in any way in the *recipe*

 - **Recipe**: the set of instructions which use the specified *sources*, and
    *processes* them in steps to generate the final data *product*
 
 - **Lineage**: metadata that can be used to trace a *product* back to its
    *source*, which includes all data *artifacts*
